## Project explanation

The starting point of this project was to compile a E/R diagram following some initial instructions. 
After that I could watch to the real database and working on the models.
Thanks to the constructor inside the models I can create instances of my classes.
A database connection allows me to make my query directly. 
On the view there are all the users ordered by their likes' no, descendingly.
